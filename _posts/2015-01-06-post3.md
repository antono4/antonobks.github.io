Optimization is an important concept in mathematics and related fields. The idea is to maximize (or minimize) a certain desired criteria (function, specifically called objective function or goal function) while satisfying the relevant restrictions (called constraints), if there are any. Optimization is common in traditional engineering industries, decision making, operations research, machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence and many more, making it almost ubiquitous.
