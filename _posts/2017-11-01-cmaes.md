Optimization is an important concept in mathematics and related fields. The idea is to maximize (or minimize) a certain desired criteria (function, specifically called objective function or goal function) while satisfying the relevant restrictions (called constraints), if there are any. Optimization is common in traditional engineering industries, decision making, operations research, machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence and many more, making it almost ubiquitous. 

For complex optimization problems, the global landscape of the objective function is rugged, multi-modal and patchy, where feasible regions are separated by unfeasible regions in the design variable space. The landscape becomes more complex as the dimensionality of the problem increases. Gradient based methods terminate at local minimum and unless the objective function is convex (for a minimization problem), will therefore converge to a local optimum. In problems with complex objective function landscape, we therefore need gradient free search algorithms that possess a global search capability.  

Optimization problems where one can numerically obtains the influence of the affecting (decision) variables on the value of the objective function, even in the absence of some analytic algebraic model of the system, are well suited to be solved through gradient free population based optimization metaheuristic techniques, popularly known as evolutionary algorithms. The search procedure of these algorithms uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection. One begins with an initial pool of guess solutions. This pool of solutions is referred as *population*  and the *population size* indicates the number of candidate solutions in the population. Based on the algorithmic rules, the population members explore the search space and evolve through *generations* by exchanging information between fellow members. With an appropriate implementation, one can expect the population members to converge towards the region where the mean value of the objective function is low. Convergence of the population towards an extremely low mean objective function value suggests that the algorithm approaches or approximates the global optimum.
